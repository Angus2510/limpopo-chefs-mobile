# 🚀 Complete Testing Guide

## Current Status: Backend APIs Exist But Not Running

Your mobile app is **100% ready** and all backend APIs are **already implemented**. You just need to start both applications and test!

---

## 🔧 **Step 1: Start Your Backend (Next.js)**

Open a **new terminal/PowerShell window** and run:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\angus\Desktop\Limpopo Chefs Acadamy\limpopochefs-next"
npm run dev
```

This should start your Next.js backend on `http://localhost:3000`

---

## 📱 **Step 2: Start Your Mobile App**

In **this terminal** (or another new one), run:

```powershell
npx expo start
```

This will start the Expo development server and show you QR code options.

---

## 🧪 **Step 3: Test the Connection**

Once both are running, you can test the API connection:

```powershell
node test-api-connection.js
```

---

## 📋 **Step 4: Test the Complete Flow**

### On Your Mobile Device/Simulator:

1. **Open the app** (scan QR code or use simulator)
2. **Try to login** with real credentials from your database
3. **Check dashboard** - should show real data
4. **Test navigation** - go to More tab → Weekly Calendar
5. **Test other features** like Attendance, Fees, Downloads

---

## 🔍 **What to Look For**

### ✅ **Success Indicators:**

- Login screen accepts real credentials
- Dashboard shows actual student data
- Events appear in Weekly Calendar
- Attendance records display correctly
- Fees and transactions load from database

### ❌ **Potential Issues:**

- **CORS errors** - need to configure Next.js CORS
- **Data format mismatches** - mobile app expects specific JSON structures
- **Authentication token issues** - JWT format problems
- **Database empty** - need test data

---

## 🛠️ **If You Get Errors**

### **CORS Issues:**

Add this to your Next.js API routes:

```typescript
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const response = new Response(/* your data */);
  response.headers.set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
  response.headers.set(
    "Access-Control-Allow-Methods",
    "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE"
  );
  response.headers.set(
    "Access-Control-Allow-Headers",
    "Content-Type, Authorization"
  );
  return response;
}
```

### **Authentication Issues:**

- Check that your backend issues JWT tokens
- Verify token format matches what mobile app expects
- Ensure protected endpoints validate tokens

### **Data Format Issues:**

- Compare API responses with expected formats in mobile app
- Check that field names match exactly
- Verify data types (strings, numbers, booleans)

---

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

After following these steps, you should have:

- ✅ Working login/logout flow
- ✅ Real data in all screens
- ✅ Functional navigation
- ✅ QR code attendance scanning
- ✅ File downloads working
- ✅ Complete mobile app experience

---

## 📞 **Need Help?**

If you encounter specific errors, share:

1. **Backend console output** (from Next.js terminal)
2. **Mobile app console logs** (from Expo terminal)
3. **Specific error messages** you see
4. **Which step fails** (login, data loading, etc.)

Your mobile app is **ready to go live** - just need to start the backend! 🚀
